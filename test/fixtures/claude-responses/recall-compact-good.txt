# Project Memory

## Architecture
- API uses Express with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Auth: JWT-based with refresh tokens

## Patterns
- All API routes follow REST conventions
- Error handling via middleware
- Input validation with zod schemas

## Last Session
Working on user profile endpoints. Added GET /api/users/:id and PATCH /api/users/:id.
Next: add avatar upload endpoint and write integration tests.
